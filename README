		User-space NFS Client
		=====================

Introduction
------------

unfsclient is a FUSE-based user-space NFS client that aims at
higher scalability and performance than the in-kernel client stack.
Most would disagree with this notion but to disprove such a notion is
the goal of unfsclient project. It aims to achieve higher scalability
and performance through intelligent, efficient and aggressive algorithms
to beat the I/O bottleneck of being in the user-space. It also aims to
be extensible and flexible to allow experimentation with a range of
algorithms for data and meta-data caching, I/O and network connection
management, locking and concurrency for file systems in user-space,
etc. One of the benefits of being in user-space is to allow
experimentation with various types of policies, to that end,
unfsclient will attempt to provide configurable subsystems.

As of this writing, the work is not complete yet. The main components
ready for testing are:
1. Async RPC library.
2. NFSv3 client operations library.
